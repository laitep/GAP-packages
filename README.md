## GAP-packages

This respository is a collection of currently 23 GAP packages, 
each of which contains a list of small models for a given class of algebras.

Each package has a function which lists, for each sufficiently small natural number N, 
a complete and minimal set of representatives of isomorphy classes of the models of order N
(of the given class of algebras).
 
To install the package move the package you are interested in into the subfolder 
         
       pkg

of your GAP home folder.

In order to load a package, e.g. the package "SmallShelf-0.1.0, start GAP and then type

	LoadPackage("SmallShelf");
