# GAP-packages

This respository is a collection of currently 21 GAP packages, 
each of which contains a list of low order models for a given class of algebras.

Each package has a function which lists, for a given (not too large) natural number N

of the given class of algebras.
 
To install the package move the package you are interested in into the subfolder pkg
of your GAP home folder.
